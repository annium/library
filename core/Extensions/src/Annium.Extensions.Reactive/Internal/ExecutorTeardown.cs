/// Both the source and the caller's own handler can end the sequence, and they can do so at the same

/// an earlier value has not run yet. Letting each path dispose and notify on its own meant whichever
/// background task finished first decided the outcome, so a real handler failure could be replaced by the
/// completion that happened to win. Teardown therefore happens once: the first caller starts it, later
/// ones only record what they know, and the failure - whenever it was recorded - beats the completion.
