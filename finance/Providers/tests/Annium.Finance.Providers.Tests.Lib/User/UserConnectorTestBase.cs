/// Base for tests that drive a provider's live user connector against a real exchange account. This is not
/// a sandbox: derived tests place, fill, cancel and modify real orders on the account identified by the
/// <see cref="UserSettings"/> passed to the constructor, and this base actively manages that account's state
/// around each test - on setup it cancels every open order on <see cref="Symbol"/> and closes any active
/// position on it, and on teardown it cancels open orders again and market-sells off any remaining position,
/// so tests start and leave the account flat. Everything derived from this base is in the write block, and
/// nothing but that block selects it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// One provider derives from this: the Binance USD-M futures suite. Spot has no user-connector tests at all -
/// only provider ones - so nothing exercises a spot user connector, gated or otherwise. Two commented-out
/// bases used to stand in for that coverage, one of them carrying a position-closing filter that skipped
/// short positions, which is a defect already fixed here; they were removed rather than left as something to
/// revive. The coverage they implied still does not exist.
