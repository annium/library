/// Publishing is durable against broker outages: the publish channel enables publisher confirms with tracking, so

/// unreachable the publishing is buffered in an in-process retry loop (relying on the connection's automatic recovery to
/// reopen the channel) and retried until confirmed — giving zero loss across a transient outage.
